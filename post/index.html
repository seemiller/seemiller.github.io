            Rails - From the Closet To Kubernetes - SSL Part 3. Building and maintaining a web application back in the day was a lot of work. There were of course standards and best practices, but actual implementation was often quite difficult or laborious. As an example, let us consider securing a web application with TLS certificates. Years ago everything was harder when developing with a TLS certificate. Acquiring a certificate was difficult and expensive.

            Rails - From the Closet To Kubernetes - Scaling Part 2. Continuing the story from Deploying Rails from the Closet to Kubernetes - Deploymnet. Way back in 2007, our application, Pivotal Tracker, was deployed to a bare metal server in a closet in the office. This single server hosted the Rails application and the MySQL database. This situation was obviously not ideal, at least not to today&rsquo;s standards. One server, and a noisy one I came to later find out, in a closet.

        <p>
            Rails - From the Closet To Kubernetes - Deployment Part 1. From mid-2007 until early 2020, I helped to develop and maintain a Ruby on Rails application, Pivotal Tracker. I got to see almost the entire lifecycle of this application. When I joined the Tracker team at Pivotal Labs in mid 2007, the app already had its core functionality, but it needed its edges rounded out. For our use as an internal project management application, those rough edges were ok, but we worked to round them out and make it a full-fledged product.
