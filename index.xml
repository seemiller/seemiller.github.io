      <description>Rails - From the Closet To Kubernetes - Scaling Part 2. Continuing the story from Deploying Rails from the Closet to Kubernetes - Deploymnet. Way back in 2007, our application, Pivotal Tracker, was deployed to a bare metal server in a closet in the office. This single server hosted the Rails application and the MySQL database. This situation was obviously not ideal, at least not to today&amp;rsquo;s standards. One server, and a noisy one I came to later find out, in a closet.</description>

      <description>Rails - From the Closet To Kubernetes - Deployment From mid-2007 until early 2020, I helped to develop and maintain a Ruby on Rails application, Pivotal Tracker. I got to see almost the entire lifecycle of this application. When I joined the Tracker team at Pivotal Labs in mid 2007, the app already had its core functionality, but it needed its edges rounded out. For our use as an internal project management application, those rough edges were ok, but we worked to round them out and make it a full-fledged product.</description>
